## Project Title: "Jak Dojadę" - University Task Solution

This project provides a solution to the "Jak Dojadę" task as part of university coursework. The implementation is developed in C/C++ without using the Standard Template Library (STL). Instead, core data structures such as queues, lists, hash maps, and pairs have been custom-implemented using templates to fulfill the task's constraints and requirements.

The project incorporates well-known algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS) for traversing graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths.
